  19.3 Error Correction parity P
  (24, 20)Read-Solomon code over GF(2^6)
   Polynominal: P(X) = X^6 + X + 1
   1 symbol = 6 bit

   The parity matrix WHp is:
               {  1   1   1 . . .  1 1}
          Hp = {a23 a22 a21 . . . a1 1}
               {a46 a44 a42 . . . a2 1}
               {a69 a66 a63 . . . a3 1}

   The primitive element a of GF(2^6) is:

                   msb      lsb
              a = (0 0 0 0 1 0)

   The parity symbols P0 = P - S24n+20 and P1 = P - S24n+21, P2 = P - S24n+22 and P3 = P - S24n+23
   are defined to satisfy the following question:

              Hp X Vp = 0
   where
               {D - S24n}
          Vp = {D - S24n+1}
               {D - S24n+2}
               {D - S24n+3}
                  :
               {D - S24n+23}
  
  19.7 Error Correction parity Q
  (4, 2)Read-Solomon code over GF(2^6)
   Polynominal: P(X) = X^6 + X + 1
   1 symbol = 6 bit

   The parity matrix WHq is:
          Hq = { 1  1  1 1}
               {a3 a2 a1 1}

   The primitive element a of GF(2^6) is:

         msb      lsb
    a = (0 0 0 0 1 0)

   The parity symbols Q0 = D - S24n+2 and Q1 = D - S24n+3 are defined to satisfy the following
   equation:
               Hq x Vq = 0
   where
               {D - S24n}
          Vq = {D - S24n + 1}
               {D - S24n + 2}
               {D - S24n + 3}

   This Q-parity system combined with scrambling and interleaving can correct an error burst of
   59 subcoding symbols on the disc by using a single symbol correcting strategy (symbols 0, 1, 2
   and 3 only).

   => ISO/IEC 10149:1995 (http://standards.iso.org/ittf/PubliclyAvailableStandards/index.html)
      14.5 P-Parity field p17, 14.6 Q-Parity field p17, Annex A pp25-28
       This document is the specification of the CD-ROM, and these pages are described about
      EDC(Error Detection Code), ECC(Error Correction Code).
       EDC, ECC is coded by "ecm - Encoder/decoder for Error Code Modeler format" of Neill Corlett.
      So, I can use these documents and source codes as reference, but I don't understand these yet.

. read lead-in precisely
  http://senbee.seesaa.net/article/20732055.html
  http://www.13thmonkey.org/documentation/SCSI/mmc6r02g.pdf p43
  [quote]
   Addressing in the program area begins with 00:00:00. This advances up through the Lead-out.
   The last frame in the Lead-in is 99:59:74 and decreases as the spiral is followed toward the center of the disc.
   The Lead-in is typically 3 to 4 minutes in length.
  [/quote]
   => I don't know the precise length of the Lead-in. I want the specification about the Lead-in/out.

. read DVD as 2064 byte

   A DVD data sector contains 2 064 bytes, containing 2 048 bytes of main data and 16 bytes of additional
   information.
  [/quote]
   => Does use Read Buffer command(0x3c) or Hitachi specific command(0xE7) to dump the raw data?
