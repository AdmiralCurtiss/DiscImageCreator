. fix C2 error disc per byte.
  A number of error bytes per sector according to the 294-bytes C2-error part
  in each sector and to take the good bytes from each rereading, instead of
  trying to reread the entire sector without errors.

. support cue file for multisession disc
  SESSION directives

. support mdf/mds (for SecuROM v4 or higher, StarForce, CD-Cops)

. support twin sector disc (for ALPHA-ROM, ROOT, TAGES)

. support illegal or fake TOC disc (for CDS-100)

. support 0xd8 ripping of SONY, PIONEER

   => I don't have these old drive yet.

. check the SubRtoW of the PSX
   => Sub[35] (The last of the SubR), Sub[47] (The last of the SubS),
      Sub[59] (The last of the SubT), Sub[71] (The last of the SubU),
      Sub[83] (The last of the SubV), Sub[95] (The last of the SubW)
      If submode is 'Raw', these byte is 0x01, 0x02 or 0x03 in some game.
      If submode is 'Pack', these byte is all 0x00.
      => Which is the right data?

. check parity P, Q for CD+G

  Read-Solomon code over GF(2^6)
   Polynominal:
    P(X) = X^6 + X + 1
   1 symbol = 6 bit
   The parity matrix WHq is:
    Hq = { 1  1  1 1}
         {a3 a2 a1 1}
   The primitive element a of GF(2^6) is:
         msb      lsb
    a = (0 0 0 0 1 0)
   The parity symbols Q0 = D - S24n+2 and Q1 = D - S24n+3 are defined to satisfy
   the following equation:
    Hq x Vq = 0
   where
         {D - S24n}
    Vq = {D - S24n + 1}
         {D - S24n + 2}
         {D - S24n + 3}
   This Q-parity system combined with scrambling and interleaving can correct
   an error burst of 59 subcoding symbols on the disc by using a single symbol
   correcting strategy (symbols 0, 1, 2 and 3 only)

. read lead-in precisely

   Addressing in the program area begins with 00:00:00. This advances up through the Lead-out.
   The last frame in the Lead-in is 99:59:74 and decreases as the spiral is followed toward the center of the disc.
   The Lead-in is typically 3 to 4 minutes in length.
  [/quote]
   => I don't know the precise length of the Lead-in. I want the specification about the Lead-in/out.

. read DVD as 2064 byte

   A DVD data sector contains 2 064 bytes, containing 2 048 bytes of main data and 16 bytes of additional
   information.
  [/quote]
   => Does use Read Buffer command(0x3c) or Hitachi specific command(0xE7) to dump the raw data?
